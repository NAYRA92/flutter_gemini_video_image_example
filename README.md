## About our AI model - Gemini ‚ú®
Gemini is a family of multimodal large language models developed by Google DeepMind, serving as the successor to LaMDA and PaLM 2. Comprising Gemini Ultra, Gemini Pro, and Gemini Nano, it was announced on December 6, 2023, positioned as a competitor to OpenAI's GPT-4. It powers the generative artificial intelligence chatbot of the same name. Yep, this is from wikipedia. In short words, Gemini is a multimodal AI powered chatbot that takes both images and texts as input. 
The Gemini model has been modified to suit our application needs by adding system prompts to get our results.
